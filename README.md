# pet-project-divizia-db-constructor

It's a web application that allows you to configure the database in a user-friendly interface. That is, you can create a table, add the necessary requisites to it, and then fill it with records. All tables are actually created in the database (app sends native queries instead of you). The logic and idea are borrowed from the salesforce platform.
